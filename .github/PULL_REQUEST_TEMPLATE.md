* Import the **Capability examples** questionnaire from pre-prod Author into your local environment and:
    * ensure it can be opened in Author;
    * then, ensure it can be viewed in Runner by pressing the **view survey** button
* Does this require a migration? We need one if existing JSON schema properties change
