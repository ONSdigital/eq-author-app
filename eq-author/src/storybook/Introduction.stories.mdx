# Author design system

The Author design system helps us make Author:

* user focussed
* inclusive
* clear and simple
* consistent, and
* relevant.

## User focussed

We understand our users and focus on solving their problems.

This means we:

* collaborate with users throughout our design and development process
* look at the full context of what authors are trying to achieve, not just the part where they interact with Author
* use the same language as our users, and
* allow users to undo and redo actions.

## Inclusive

We let people use Author with any modern device or technology they choose.

This means our designs are:

* flexible across screens, devices and technologies, and
* useful, efficient and satisfying to all users.

## Clear and simple

We make Author easy to use, with straightforward actions that people can easily understand and remember.

This means:

* we use plain English
* the most commonly used actions are front and centre
* the user does as little as possible, both cognitively and physically, and
* every element on a page has a purpose - there's no clutter.

## Consistent

We avoid confusion and build confidence in Author by providing consistent experiences.

This means:

* elements look and behave in the same way throughout the app, and are consistent with general practice
* existing components are used and new ones only created when absolutely necessary, and
* content has the same tone and style.

## Relevant

We give people the right information, at the right time, in the right way.

This means we:

* consider different channels for providing information
* give meaningful feedback in response to every user action, and
* provide contextual help to users.
